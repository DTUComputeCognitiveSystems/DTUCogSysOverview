# Cognitive Systems (CogSys)
Modern life is embedded in intelligent systems, from the mind reading Internet to hearing aids listening in on our conversations.

Advanced data analysis is increasingly a determinant for productivity and personal quality of life. 

The Section for Cognitive Systems research information processing in man and computer, with a particular focus on the signals they exchange – audio, imagery, behavior – and the opportunities these signals offer for modeling and prediction. 

Our research is based on statistical machine learning and signal processing, on quantitative analysis of digital media and text, on mobility and complex networks, and on cognitive psychology.
